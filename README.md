# ListList

__ListList__ (or ListÂ²) is an open source web application for managing lists.
The design takes inspiration from to-do list applications, with the intention
of moving away from kanban board-style UI trends (which are awful, imo).


## The problem
Managing multiple lists of information is sometimes hard, and many of the
solutions available on the market include a ridiculous amount of bells and
whistles and follow less-than-great design patterns.

## Platform

This app sits on top of Rails 5, which is fairly straightforward to deploy to
a development, testing, or production environment. By default, the database
uses Postgres.
